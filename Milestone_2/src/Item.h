     *  Upon instantiation, an Item object receives either nothing or a reference to an 
     *  unmodifiable std::string. This string contains all of the information for a single item.
     *
     *  The constructor initializes the description string to "no detailed description" and code 
     *  to the default initial code (1) for all items. The constructor extracts tokens from the 
     *  string received using a Utilities object. It accepts the first token as the name of the 
     *  item and reports an exception if no name is specified. It accepts the second token as 
     *  the name of the source task that inserts the item into a product and reports an exception 
     *  if no task is specified. It accepts the third token as the destination task that extracts
     *  the item from a product and reports an exception if no task is specified. The fourth token
     *  is the integer holding the code to be printed on the item’s first insertion. The fifth 
     *  token is a detailed description of the item.
     *
     *  The constructor resets the field_width of the Item class if the size of the item name exceeds
     *  the current field_width.
